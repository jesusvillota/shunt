# Model on/off list in shunt tui

Goal `model-filter` · format `goal/v2`. Live status is derived from GitHub and git and is
never written here: run `goal status model-filter` or `goal tui`.

Let the operator switch codex, opencode and agy models on or off in shunt tui, feed only the active models to the goal tool and /delegate-cli, and show OpenCode free-model status and an on-demand ranking.

## Context, scope and non-goals

<what exists today, what is included, what is explicitly out of scope>

## Risks and open questions

<risks, assumptions, and unknowns; material unknowns become discovery tasks or DEC nodes>

## Worker protocol

For an agent executing exactly one task of this goal:

1. Work only on your task, in your own branch and worktree, branched from `origin/main`.
2. Read `tasks/TASK-NNN.md` (the spec), the outcomes of the tasks it depends on, and the
   accepted decisions it depends on. Never edit specs, other tasks, decisions or `goal.yaml`.
3. After your first commit, open a draft PR into `main` whose body contains the line
   `Goal-Task: model-filter/TASK-NNN`. Write the body with real newlines.
   Use `gh pr create --body-file FILE` or `gh pr edit --body-file FILE`.
   If the repo has several remotes, resolve `origin` with `git remote get-url origin`.
   For a GitHub origin, use `gh pr create --repo <origin OWNER/NAME> --body-file FILE`.
   Pass the same `--repo <origin OWNER/NAME>` to every other `gh pr` command.
4. Do the work and run the spec's Verify commands.
5. Write `tasks/TASK-NNN.outcome.md` with an `## Acceptance` checklist (each item followed by
   its evidence) and a `## Summary` (what, how, deviations, verified revision, proposed
   follow-ups). Commit it in the same PR.
6. Mark the PR ready for review when checks pass or none are configured.
   Failing or pending checks block delivery unless repository or owner rules explicitly
   override that requirement. Follow those rules for allowed evidence sources. Never merge.
7. Blocked by a missing decision, access or data? Explain it in the outcome, add the line
   `Goal-Blocked: <reason>` to the draft PR body, and stop. For a material decision, also
   write `## Decision request` in the outcome with the question, options and trade-offs,
   and your recommendation under `### Recommendation` (omit it if you have none). Add
   `Goal-Decision: <one-line question>` to the draft PR body, commit and push, then stop
   through exit (B). Refresh or `goal sync` creates a decision in the Inbox. Under
   `decide: experts`, the committee gives opinions. A copilot or orchestrator shell records
   the final call with `goal decide`; the ledger names `experts` as the decider.
   The owner can accept or reject any open decision as the human. After acceptance,
   the Resume task action in `:` resumes the task with the decision in its resume note.
